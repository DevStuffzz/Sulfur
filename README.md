# Sulfur Engine 0.1

## About
Sulfur is a cross-platoform open-sourced 2D game engine that uses the swing graphics library.

## Features

### Rendering
Right now the engine is only capable of rendering squares, but you can put on a circle texture with alpha to render circles. You are able to render both solid colors and textures, using either .png or .jpg formats. The renderer also supports text rendering and line rendering

### Physics
The Sulfur Physics Engine only has collision between two squares.

### Sounds
Sulfur is able to play sounds using .wav or .mp3 formats.

### Ui
Right now Sulfur has working buttons, aswell as text rendering.

### Limitations
* There is no current native support for spritesheets
to add these features.
* It is meant only simple games, and is single threaded making it quite slow, but just fine for small scale projects.

### Animations
Right now Sulfur is able to render animations using .GIF format.

### Plans
* Full Physics System
* Spritesheet
